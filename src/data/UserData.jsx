  about : "I’m a self-taught MERN stack developer passionate about building dynamic, responsive, and accessible web applications that work seamlessly across all devices. I specialize in crafting creative and user-centric solutions that enhance the overall user experience. With strong proficiency in React.js, Express.js, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, I bring both design sensitivity and backend logic to every project. I write clean, optimized code and follow best practices for performance and scalability. In addition to development, I’m skilled in Git version control for efficient code management and team collaboration. I’ve also gained hands-on experience with Docker, allowing me to containerize applications for consistent deployment across environments. Security is a priority in my workflow. I understand and implement preventive measures against common vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. I am constantly learning and evolving to stay current with modern web technologies and security practices.",
